# 🐍 Snake Game

Welcome to my simple, classic Snake Game! 🎮
This project brings back the nostalgia of the old-school Snake experience — eat food, grow longer, and try not to crash!

# ✨ Features
## 🎯 Core Features

Classic Gameplay: Move the snake around the grid to eat food and grow.

Score Tracking: Your score increases each time the snake eats food.

Game Over Detection: The game ends if you hit the wall or your own tail.

Restart Anytime: Easily start over with a click or key press.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built using simple, fundamental web technologies:

## 🧱 Frontend

HTML: Builds the structure and layout of the game.

CSS: Styles the visuals, creating a clean and minimal interface.

JavaScript: Handles all the game logic — movement, collisions, scoring, and rendering.

# 🎮 How to Play

Use the arrow keys (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️) to move the snake.

Eat the red food to grow your snake and increase your score.

Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail, or the game will end.

Press Restart to play again and beat your high score!
